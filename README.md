# NSCC
## An HP NonStop TCP/IP Library

This library is a work in progress. Its goal will be to abstract away, much of the nit-and-gritty
of the C TCP/IP logic used in NonStop Server Processes. This project is geared towards Guardian
and should be easily adapted for OSS.

As of now this project is untested and unbuilt. I am simply in the processes of writing the logic.
